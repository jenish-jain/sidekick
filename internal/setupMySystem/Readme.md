# Set up My System

The Idea is to develop a brew tool that helps user to take care of its system setup

should have a default setup mode may be by category like for 
developer, 
devops, 
muggles (normal users), 
code architects?
or someone preparing for war (everything in the belt)

use a common tool belt categories by category or tags to take care of it.

try taking care of even some setup required post setting up the tool, like setting a path, profiles and everything
